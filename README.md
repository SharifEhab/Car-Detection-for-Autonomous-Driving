# Car Detection for Autonomous Driving

Programming Assignment from Andrew Ng's Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Specialization.

This project focuses on detecting objects in images using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm to assist in autonomous driving applications. The input is an image captured by a self-driving car, and the output is bounding boxes around detected objects.

## YOLO Algorithm

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a highly efficient algorithm in computer vision, widely used for object detection. It can make real-time predictions, which is essential for applications such as autonomous driving.

### Key Concepts

- **Single Shot Detection**: YOLO processes the entire image in a single forward pass through the network, unlike traditional methods, such as sliding windows, which analyze each part of the image individually. This approach is computationally efficient and fast.
- **Grid System**: The image is divided into a grid, and each cell predicts bounding boxes along with confidence scores for potential objects. This allows YOLO to detect multiple objects in a single image.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Optimized for real-time detection, YOLO achieves high frame rates without sacrificing accuracy, making it ideal for autonomous driving applications.

### Why YOLO is Efficient

YOLO’s efficiency stems from its unique approach to object detection:
1. **Single Network for Detection**: YOLO uses one convolutional neural network (CNN) to both locate and classify objects in a single pass, unlike region proposal-based methods that involve multiple stages.
2. **Spatial Constraints**: By dividing the image into a grid, YOLO reduces redundant processing, focusing each grid cell on a specific region, which speeds up detection.
3. **Unified Model Architecture**: YOLO skips the need for separate region proposals and post-processing, unlike region-based CNNs (R-CNNs) that classify proposals and refine predictions, which adds complexity.
4. **Balanced Trade-off Between Speed and Accuracy**: YOLO’s design enables real-time detection while achieving reasonable accuracy, making it effective for small and large object detection without extra computational load.

## Bounding Boxes

The output of the YOLO algorithm consists of bounding boxes, each containing:
- **Class Label**: The detected object’s category (e.g., car, pedestrian).
- **Confidence Score**: The probability that the object belongs to the predicted class.
- **Coordinates**: The bounding box location, defining the position of the detected object within the image.

### Example of Bounding Boxes

Below is an example of bounding boxes generated by the YOLO algorithm:

## Advantages Over Traditional Algorithms

YOLO provides notable improvements over sliding window and region-based CNN approaches:
- **Significant Speed Boost**: Capable of real-time image processing, which is essential for self-driving applications.
- **Reduced Computation**: Single-pass detection simplifies processing and minimizes computation time.
- **Improved Contextual Understanding**: YOLO’s holistic image perspective helps avoid false positives, such as misidentifying background elements.
